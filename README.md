# Scilla - A 3D Graphics Engine

**Scilla** is a 3D graphics engine I'm building in **C++23** and **OpenGL 4.6** (DSA).
Its purpose is to help me learn graphics programming, engine architecture, and modern C++.

**Current Goal:** To create a functioning "walking simulator" with physics-based movement and natural landscapes.
