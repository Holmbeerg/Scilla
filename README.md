# Scilla - A Custom 3D Game Engine

**Scilla** is a custom 3D game engine I'm building in **C++** and **Modern OpenGL (4.6)**.
Its purpose is to help me learn graphics programming, engine architecture, and modern C++.

**Current Goal:** To create a functioning "walking simulator" with physics-based movement and natural landscapes.
