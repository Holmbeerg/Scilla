Vertex Array Objects (VAO):
To use a VAO all you have to do is bind the VAO using glBindVertexArray. From that point on we
should bind/configure the corresponding VBO(s) and attribute pointer(s) and then unbind the VAO
for later use.

VAO stores our vertex attribute configuration and which VBO to use. Usually when you have
multiple objects you want to draw, you first generate/configure all the VAOs (and thus the required
VBO and attribute pointers) and store those for later use. The moment we want to draw one of our objects,
we take the corresponding VAO, bind it, then draw the object and unbind the VAO again.

Element Buffer Objects (EBO):
indexed drawing, only need to specify unique vertices.
The last element buffer object that gets bound while a VAO is bound,
is stored as the VAO's element buffer object. Binding to a VAO then
also automatically binds that EBO.
